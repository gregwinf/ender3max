# This file contains pin mappings for the stock 2020 Creality Ender 3
# MAX. To use this config, during "make menuconfig" select the
# STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader" and serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9)
# communication.

# Because this printer has factory wiring, mounts, and firmware for
# a BLTouch, but does not ship with one at this time, default values
# for the sensor have been specified, but disabled, in anticipation of
# future revisions or user modification. User should take care to
# customize the offsets, particularly z-offset, for their specific unit.

# If you prefer a direct serial connection, in "make menuconfig"
# select "Enable extra low-level configuration options" and select
# serial (on USART3 PB11/PB10), which is broken out on the 10 pin IDC
# cable used for the LCD module as follows:
# 3: Tx, 4: Rx, 9: GND, 10: VCC

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
